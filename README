INTRODUCTION
------------
"XMLTP Light" is a lightweight RPC protocol which uses XML to
encode the stream of data.  It has been designed to do fast RPC
calls over an _intranet_, within an enterprise, to forward
transactions (RPCs) to a database server. 

The name of "XMLTP Light" evokes its purposes and design goals:
- to transport "TP Light" -- lightweight On-Line Transaction
Processing, see NOTE(1) -- remote procedure calls (RPC),
- use a XML syntax to allow compatibility with various tools,
existing or future,
- have a lightweight, robust, implementation,
- good performance, with modest requirements (therefore, real 
practical scalability using simple hardware configurations).

To achieve its goal of being fast and "lightweight", XMLTP/L 
acknowledges the following constraints and limitations as
"non-goals":
- XMLTP/L does not pretend to do everything, 
- it uses a subset of XML (a full-fledge XML parser can 
parse XMLTP/L, but, not the reverse),
- is not a universal transport for all datatypes,
- is not the most "standardized" or the most buzzwords 
compliant technology to appear now, yesterday or tomorrow,
- it is not as easy to install as XML-RPC (which is less 
than 20 KB of code in the Python 2.x standard install!).

XMLTP/L is much more boring than other XML protocols such as
SOAP or XML-RPC or any newer web services protocols that 
will appear real-soon-now.

But, if it fills someone's need for a non-proprietary, robust,
and flexible RPC protocol on their intranet, then, it is
just plain great. 

XMLTP/L should be appealing to people who use stored procedure
calls, and, who want more flexibility (multiple DBMS), and some
level of XML compliance without suffering response time greater
than 300 or 500 ms (all implementations of RPC-over-XML that I
have tried so far...  not all of them, but, enough to convince to
write a custom XML subset parser). 

Please see "XMLTP_intro.html" file for a longer description
and more details.
