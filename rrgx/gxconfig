# $Header$
#
# Gateways XMLTP/L config file "gxconfig"
# ---------------------------------------
# 
# The "-Ttype" argument must be given on the command line of the server 
# startup. The loading of the config parameters is done in three (3) 
# steps:
#	1) the "BASE" section is loaded
#	2) the "type" section is loaded (RRG or CLIENT_GATEWAY)
#	3) the "server_name" section of the "dbsrvcfg.<hostname>" file
#	   is loaded.
#
# If a parameter loaded at steps 2 or 3 was previously defined
# the new value associated with the parameter overrides the old one.
#

# Versions:
# 2003jan24,jft: first version of this file.
# 2003sep29,jft: added TRACE_INIT 
# 2006feb09,jft: intercept example is now "out1"
#		 out1_STORAGE  PERSISTENT # uses persistent storage
#		 PERSISTENT_QUEUES_DIR   ./QueuesStorage
# 2006jun12,jft: out1_STORAGE  IN_MEMORY -- so, it can work out of the box, without Berkeley DB nor bsddb3

#
# BASE - Common configuration section shared by all types of servers
#
BASE
	# TRACE_INIT assigns trace levels to various groupes on modules:
	#
	TRACE_INIT			server		callparser	rpc	\
					connpool	intercept
	#
	# The TRACE value can be a number, like 1 to 20 (or even higher like 40 if needed),
	# or, one of the following keywords: none, low, medium, full
	# All of this is similar to the "trace" operator command.
	#
	TRACE_rpc			medium	# for unit testing and debugging
	##TRACE_rpc			low	# a lower trace level gives faster performance
	TRACE_server			low
	TRACE_callparser		low
	TRACE_connpool			low
	TRACE_intercept			medium



	CALLPARSERSPOOL_MAXRES	25		### can be fine-tuned

	# NOTE:
	#	 MAX_CLIENTS_SOCKETS is the maximum number of client sockets (total)
	#	 MAX_CLT_CONNECTIONS is the max number of ordinary client connections
	#	 (non admin) 
	#	 The config must have:
	#		MAX_CLIENTS_SOCKETS > MAX_CLT_CONNECTIONS 
	#
	#	 Your server might have a large number (more than 1000) of client connections,
	#	 or a small number (less than 200). You should adjust the values of these
	#	 two parameters in your "gxconfig.hostname" file.
	#
	MAX_CLIENTS_SOCKETS	500	# see also below, MAX_CLT_CONNECTIONS

	MAX_CLT_CONNECTIONS	200	# Maximum Client Logins

	# RPC_TIMEOUT and RPC_RETRY -- NOTES for gxserver (RRG-X and CLIENT_GATEWAY) and XML2SYB
	# -------------------------    ------------------------------------------------
	#
	#   The Java or VB clients must be configured with a RPC timeout of 210 seconds and
	#   NO retry (retry=1).
	#
	#   CLIENT_GATEWAY must be configured with RPC timeout:   20 + 140 seconds (NO retry, except broken connection)
	#   RRG-X must be configured with RPC timeout:   50 + 70 seconds (NO retry, except broken connection)
	#   XML2SYB must be configured with RPC timeout: 10 + 50 sec. (only 2 retry on DEADLOCK within first 10 sec)
	#
	#   The following inequations must be kept true to avoid dataserver congestion:
	#
	#
	#		XML2SYB          RRG         CLIENT_GW      Java or VB
	#		--------      -----------    ----------     ----------
	#		(10 + 50)  <  70    50+70  < 140  20+140  <  175
	#
	#
	#   This config avoids database server congestion caused by multiple clients 
	#   retrying RPC while the CLIENT_GATEWAY/RRG/XML2SYB is not finished waiting for the completion of 
	#   the previous RPC request.
